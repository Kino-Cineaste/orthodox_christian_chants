\markup { \psalm #"Set, O Lord, a watch before my mouth, and a door of enclosure round about my lips. Incline not my heart unto words of evil to make excuse with excuses in sins; with men that work iniquity and I will not join with their chosen. The righteous man will chasten me with mercy and reprove me. As for the oil of the sinner, let it not anoint my head. For yet more is my prayer in the presence of their pleasures. Swallowed up near by the rock have their judges been. They shall hear my words, for they be sweetened. As a clod of earth is broken upon the earth, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto hades. For unto Thee, O Lord, O Lord are mine eyes. In Thee have I hoped. take not my soul away. Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me and from the stumbling blocks of them that work iniquity. The sinners shall fall into their own net. I am alone until I pass by. With my voice unto the Lord have I cried, with my voice unto the Lord have I made supplication. I will pour out before Him my supplication. Mine affliction before Him will I declare. When my spirit was fainting within me, then Thou knewest my paths. In this way wherein I have walked they hid for me a snare. I looked upon my right hand and beheld and there was none that did know me. Flight hath failed me and there is none that watcheth out for my soul. I have cried unto Thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my hope. My portion art Thou in the land of the living. Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from them that persecute me, for they are stronger than I."
