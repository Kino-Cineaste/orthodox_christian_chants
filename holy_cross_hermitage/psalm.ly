\markup\psalm #"       Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy, and according to the multitude o Thy compassions blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquities and cleanse me from my sin, for I know mine iniquity and my sin is ecer before me. Against Thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that Thou mightest be justified in Thy words and prevail when Thou art judged. For behold, I was conceived in iniquites and in sins did my mother bear me. For behold, Thou hast loved truth. The hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast thou made manifest unto me. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be made clean. Thou shalt wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness. The bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice. Turn Thy face away from my sins and blot out all mine iniquites. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy presence and take not Thine Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation and with Thy governing spirit establish me. I shall teach transgressors Thy ways and the ungodly shall turn back unto Thee. Deliver from blood guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness. O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips and my mouth shall declare Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given. With whole-burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased. A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit. A heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise. Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Sion and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded. Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole-burnt offerings, then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar."
