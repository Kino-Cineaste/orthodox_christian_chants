%                        Thy youth shall be renewed as the eagleâ€™s.
%
%                        The Lord performeth deeds of mercy
%                        and executeth judgment for all them that are wronged.
%                        He hath made his ways knows unto Moses,
%                        unto the sons of Israel the things that he hath willed.
%
%                        Compassionate and merciful is the Lord,
%                        long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.
%                        Not unto the end will He be angered,
%                        neither unto eternity will He be wroth.
%                        Not according to our iniquities hath He dealt with us,
%                        Neither according to our sins hath He rewarded us.
%                        
%                        For according to the height of heaven from the earth,
%                        the Lord hath made his mercy to prevail over them that fear Him
%                        As far as the East is from the West, 
%                        so far hath He removed our iniquities from us.
%                        Like as a Father hath compassion upon his sons  
%                        so hath the Lord had compassion upon them that fear Him;
%
%                        For he knoweth whereof we are made,
%                        He hath remembered that we are dust.
%                        As for man, his days are as the grass;
%                        As a flower of the field so shall he blossom forth.
%                        For when the wind is passed over it, then it shall be gone,
%                        and no longer shall it know the place thereof.
%
%                        But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity, even unto eternity,
%                                upon them that fear Him.
%                        And His righteousness is upon the sons of sons, 
%                        On them that keep His testament 
%                                and remember His commandments to do them.
%                        The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven,
%                        and His kingdom ruleth over all.
%
%                        Bless the Lord, all ye He his angels, ye mighty in strength, 
%                        Who do His word when ye hear the voice of His words.
%                        Bless the Lord, all ye His hosts, His ministers that do His will
%                        Bless the Lord, all ye His works, in every place of His dominion.
%                        Bless the Lord, O my soul.
%
%                        Glory to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,
%                        both now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
%
%                        Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy name.
%                        Bless the Lord, O my soul.
