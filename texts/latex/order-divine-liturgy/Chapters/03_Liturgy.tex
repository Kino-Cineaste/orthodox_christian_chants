\section{Prayers Before the Beginning of Liturgy}\label{sec:prayers-before-beginning-liturgy}

\instr{The priest and deacon(s) stand around the Holy Table, make the sign of the cross and bow three times while the priest says:}

\pr{God, cleanse me a sinner and have mercy on me. \numtimes{3}}

\instr{The priest raises his hands, the deacon his orarion, as the priest says:}

\pr{O Heavenly King\ldots}

\instr{The priest and deacon(s) make the sign of the cross and bow from the waist.}

\pr{Glory to God in the Highest\ldots \numtimes{3}}

\instr{The priest and deacon(s) make the sign of the cross and bow from the waist.}

\pr{O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips\ldots}

\instr{The priest and deacon(s) make the sign of the cross and bow from the waist.}

\instr{The priest and deacon(s) again make the sign of the cross and bow from waist twice; the priest then kisses the Gospel (and the Holy Table), the deacon(s) kisses only the Holy Table. The priest and deacon(s) make the sign of the cross and bow once more.}

\instr{The deacon \subinstr{1st}, bowing his head, points toward the Holy Table and says:}

\dc{It is time for the Lord to act. Master, bless.}
